Finger Tremor Project for BME 590

The goal of our project is to design and build a non-contact finger tremor detection device that will count the number of times a finger crosses an optical beam when a patient’s hand is extended.  The device will count the number of finger crossings, up to a maximum of 15 crossings, and will have a reset button to reset the counter.

The count will be displayed as a 4-bit number, as conveyed through 4 illuminated LEDs.  The device will utilize an Arduino UNO and be enclosed in a casing that has access for a power connection, the LEDs and power and reset buttons.  The device should not slide on a flat desktop surface.  The device’s function should not be affected by ambient light.
